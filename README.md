# 📝 Language Learning Helper (Bangla) 🇧🇩

**Welcome to my Language Learning Helper project!** This one is really close to my heart because it helps people learn Bangla—my mother tongue. It’s a customized flashcard app built to make learning Bangla words and their English translations fun and interactive.

## 🌟 About the Project 		

This project is a **flashcard-based language learning tool** that helps you learn and memorize hard Bangla words along with their English meanings. If you’re looking for a simple and effective way to improve your Bangla vocabulary, this app is for you!

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Randomly generated flashcards for Bangla words and their English meanings.
- ⏳ Automatic flip feature to reveal the English meaning after a few seconds.
- ✅ Mark words as "Known" to focus only on the ones you need to learn.
- 💾 Progress is saved, so the next time you return, you'll only see words you haven't mastered yet.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Tkinter (Python GUI)
- **Backend**: Pandas (For managing word data)
- **Languages**: Bangla & English

## 🚀 How it Works

1. The app shows you a **Bangla word** first.
2. After 3 seconds, the card flips to reveal the **English translation**.
3. You can mark the word as "Known" or choose to see it again later.

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Add support for multiple languages and learning modes.
- Improve UI/UX for a more engaging experience.
- Option to import custom word lists.

I hope this little project makes learning Bangla easier for you or anyone else who’s interested in the language. Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think! 😊
